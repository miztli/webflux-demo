# Reactive programming, notes.

- The full benefits of reactive programming come into effect only if the entire stack is reactive and if all participating components (application code, runtime container, integrations) respect deferred execution, non-blocking APIs and the streaming nature of dataflow â€“ basically following the underlying assumptions.

# API Test

### Bitcoin price updates

### Tweet feeds
`GET http://localhost:8080/tweets`
```

{
    "user":"miztli",
    "message":"hello world!"
}
```
